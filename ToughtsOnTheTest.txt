Hello TripleDot Studio !
Here are my Thought on the test I just finished,

I Started thinking about it and managing organization Tuesday at 9pm,
Using my evening to create folders and thinking about how to do it.

At the end I spent a day and a half on it, pretty much 14 hours to make it.
My favorite part was making some code to link visuals and effects.

Here is how I breaked down my process :

For every task I firstly check the template on PhotoShop, then I extract all the ressources
I will use to make it on Unity. If needed I make some adjustement for exemple for the pressed
buttons.
Then I import everything on Unity, make some folder to maintain organization and adjust texture
resolution to optimize the game.
